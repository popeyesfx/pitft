Notes:



1. Added jpg image to project

2. Assembled screen as per the following web page
    https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pitft-28-inch-resistive-touchscreen-display-raspberry-pi

3. Downloaded eas install image from
    https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pitft-28-inch-resistive-touchscreen-display-raspberry-pi/easy-install

4. Burned image to memory card

5. Test run screen works but raspbian desktop is to large for screen unable to see properly. After leaving message
    on forum was directed to
    https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=95649
    This shows how to install fbcp to redirect hdmi output to screen

6. Installed FBCP
    sudo apt-get install cmake
    git clone https://github.com/tasanakorn/rpi-fbcp
    cd rpi-fbcp/
    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo install fbcp /usr/local/bin/fbcp

7. Tested fbcp, but still had same issue. Also you have to ssh into pi to run fbcp & so need a method to autostart it.

8. Autostart FBCP
    sudo nano /etc/rc.local

    add line at bottom before exit 0
    /usr/local/bin/fbcp &

9. splash screen now being displayed over desktop, this was the result of the framebuffer being set to fb1 which
    is the tft screen buffer by easy install.
    Modified the /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.conf file
        Section "Device"
        Identifier "display"
        Driver "fbdev"
        Option "fbdev" "/dev/fb0"
        EndSection

    This sets the display buffer to the hdmi one which we are mirroring to the tft.

10. Modify config.txt to force hdmi output even when no screen connected.

    Add these two lines to /boot/config.txt:
        hdmi_force_hotplug=1
        hdmi_drive=2

11. Increase resolution to make viewing easier
    Add this line to bottom of config.txt
        hdmi_cvt=640 480 60 1 0 0 0

12. Tested output works fine, pixel desktop addjusted to give best viewing
